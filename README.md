### Project Summary: Smart Light Control System Using PIR and LDR Sensors  

This project implements an automated lighting system using an Arduino with a PIR motion sensor and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to optimize energy efficiency.  

### Working Principle:  
- The LDR sensor detects ambient light levels. If the surrounding is dark, it activates LED1.  
- Once LED1 is on, the PIR sensor detects motion. If movement is detected, LED2 turns on for a second, indicating activity. If no motion is detected, LED2 remains off.  
- If the LDR detects sufficient light, the system keeps both LEDs off to save power.  

### Applications:  
- Automatic streetlights that turn on only in darkness and when movement is detected.  
- Security lighting for homes and offices.  
- Energy-efficient smart lighting systems for public spaces.  

This project enhances energy efficiency and automation by ensuring lights operate only when necessary.
